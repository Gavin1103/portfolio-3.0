    "description": "For this school project, we developed a platform to visualize statistics from the 2023 elections. In addition to the statistics, we also built a forum where users can engage in discussions â€” inspired by platforms like Reddit and Stack Overflow. The project was developed by a team of four students using Spring Boot (API) and Vue.js (frontend).\n\nWe also created a CMS system for managing the forum content. Visitors can log in using the credentials email: admin@admin.com and password: admin to explore the CMS. Please note that not all features are fully functional yet, as this was a prototype built within a limited time frame",
